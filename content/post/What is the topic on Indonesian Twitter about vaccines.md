In the wordcloud, it can be seen that the most words are vaccines themselves, then the words lawan, kena, hoax, and vaksinasi are shown in a row.

The largest distribution was Facebook which contained 2,042 content and followed in second place was Twitter, which recorded 108 hoaxes spread widely. In addition, there are also YouTube and TikTok which are not spared from the target of hoaxes.

One of the hoax according to Antaranews is that vaccines cause blood to change color.

Blood color is influenced by the oxygen content in the blood cells. If oxygen-rich blood vessels leave the heart, the blood will be bright red in color. Conversely, if the blood vessels with little oxygen content return to the heart, the blood will be dark red in color.
